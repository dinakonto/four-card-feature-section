# Frontend Mentor - Four card feature section

## What is this?
This is my response to a front-end coding challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io). Frontend Mentor provides great development challenges alongside beautiful designs, enabling you to build your skills using realistic projects.

I plan to take on most, if not all, of the free challenges in order from easiest (_'Newbie'_) to hardest (_'Advanced'_).

## The challenge
__Challenge #4__<br>
__Difficulty: Newbie__

This challenge was to build out a feature section and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

## My approach
I took a mobile-first approach, completing styling and layout for a 375px viewport width first. I then built out media queries to cater to larger widths.

I used __Sass__ to easily implement elements from the `style-guide.md` provided, and CSS grid to place the elements.

The end product is hosted on Vercel - https://four-card-feature-section-delta-six.vercel.app/


## Questions
I came out of the challenge with a few questions about my approach:

1. Was CSS grid the right choice here, or do you think flexbox could have served the design better?
2. Could I have made the cards flow into their places more easily, ie without having to manually input their grid positions?
3. Is it possible to animate the movement of cards between media queries? I couldn't find a transition property that seemed to work.

Would love to hear any hot tips you might have! üçª
